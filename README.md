###Introduction & Use cases

Using this webapp you can upload files to your very own Dropbox. By following the initial steps (see 'Usage') a dedicated folder is created within your Dropbox for your instance of this app. All files being uploaded will be stored in this folder. Once the upload is complete a shortened link will be generated to access the file.

###Requirements & Usage

This app is based on the Dropbox API implementation by BenTheDesigner. See [the readme in his repository](https://github.com/BenTheDesigner/Dropbox/blob/master/examples/readme.md) for further information about Dropbox related stuff.
